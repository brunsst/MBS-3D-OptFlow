# MBS-3D-OptFlow

MBS-3D-OptFlow provides fast and memory efficient digital volume correlation for Nvidia GPUs intended for the use with synchrotron Âµ-CT volume image data.

**26.04.2023:** Dumped the source code for knowledgeable user.

**Pending Updates**:
  - Streamlining of main.cpp (removing unused experimental features, workflows to separate files)
  - Documenting all available input parameters
  - Upload demo projects (ray cartiledge; NiTi wires)

## Quick Start Guide

### Compilation

Required libraries are LibTiff and OpenMP. The source code should compile on most Linux distributions by providing the **location of your nvcc compiler** and the **CUDA compute capability** of your GPU in the script file *build_mbsoptflow.sh*. Execute with 

***<p align="center"> sh build_mbsoptflow.sh </p>***

which will provide an executable *mbsoptflow* in the same directory.

### Performing DVC

It is highly recommended that you perform a rigid body registration (or at least a coarse manual registration of datasets) before calculating displacement fields with the DVC algorithm. This assures a large field of view and minimizes displacements. Larger motions across image boundaries and motions that are large in relation to the moving object may still pose problems.

You need to provide two greyscale tif-image sequences (8bit, 16bit or 32bit): a reference (Frame0) and a transformed image sequence (Frame1). 3D-tif files are also supported. Both image sequences need to be of the same height, widht and depth. The default output will be a dense field of displacement vectors. Frame0 and Frame1 are passed with the -i0 and -i1 argument. Currently there is no default output directory (will change that and at least catch exceptions from I/O). You need to provide it with the -o argument. Thus, the most basic program call would be:

***<p align="center"> ./mbsoptflow -i0 /path/to/my/reference/data/ -i1 /path/to/my/displaced/data/ -o /path/to/dvc/output/</p>***

A full list of available arguments and flags will follow. Right now you need to check the section *extract command line arguments* in *main.cpp* and/or *protocol_parameters.h*. The latter sets the default parameters used that can be overwritten by the arguments.

@Adrian:

Your data a very large and won't fit on a single GPU. It is recommended to use the flag *--mosaic_approximation* to calculate overlapping subvolumes sequentially. That mode assumes that no motions larger than the overlap between subvolumes occur. You will also
