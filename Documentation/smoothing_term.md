### Alpha parameter

The energy functional that is being minimized consists of a data term and a regularizing smoothing term.
During preprocessing 99.9% of the dynamic range are normalized to a 0 to 1 intensity range.
This allows expressing the contribution of the smoothing term in relative terms through the alpha parameter.
By default moderate smoothing at 7% is performed (*alpha=0.07*).
