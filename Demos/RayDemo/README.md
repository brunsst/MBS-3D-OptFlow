## Deformation of Ray Cartilage (Basic Functionality)

This demo contains downsampled 8-bit grayscale files of ÂµCT scans from ray cartilage. 
In praxis it is recommended to use higher resolution files and at least 16-bit grayscale information because texture information is crucial to perform high quality DVC.
<br>
<br>
The images in this demo are registered onto a pin (visible near the bottom of the images) that pushes against the cartilage. The demo directory contains the follwing datasets:
- ***Frame01*** serves as a reference for the undeformed cartilage.
- ***Frame02*** is deformed but the cartilage is still intact.
- ***Frame03*** exhibits severe fractures in the material phase.
- A mask on the cartilage for Frame01 (***Mask01***) is incorporated to focus on the material of interest and mask out background artefacts.
- ***raymesh.vtk*** provides a tetrahedral meshing of the mask and serves as a canvas for the projection of results. It can be opened with Paraview.

### Running the demo

A typical experiment will result in a large quantity of imaged steps. Thus, running the DVC by script is advisable. 
In the root directory of the repository you will find the script ***run_ray_demo.sh*** which upon execution will match ***Frame01*** and ***Frame02***.
Adding ***Frame03*** to the ***EXPERIMENT_LIST*** extends the DVC to an additional time step.
<br>
<br>
The script allows tuning some of the basic DVC parameters:
<br>
- [***LEVEL*** and ***SCALE***](https://github.com/brunsst/MBS-3D-OptFlow/blob/main/Documentation/gaussian_pyramid.md)
- [***ALPHA***](https://github.com/brunsst/MBS-3D-OptFlow/blob/main/Documentation/smoothing_term.md)
- [***NORMALIZATION***](https://github.com/brunsst/MBS-3D-OptFlow/blob/main/Documentation/intensity_normalization.md)
- [***PREFILTER***](https://github.com/brunsst/MBS-3D-OptFlow/blob/main/Documentation/filtering.md)

A successful program call should generate a terminal output similar to the above screenshot. When the program crashes a likely reason could be a faulty input directory. In the terminal the passed directory for Frame1 will be stated along with the identified stack sizes. These should be consistent for all data passed.

The GPU configuration section identifies the required GPU memory. When GPU memory is exceeded you will have to run in mosaic mode. Whenever possible variables are calculated on-the-fly while keeping transfer to and from the GPU minimal. If the data term needs to be precalculated for inner iterations, e.g., in local-global mode, *psimap* will be active and additional memory is required. *confidencemap* is active because we are using a mask requiring one additional copy. The *rewarp* functionality is rarely used.
<br>
<br>
The output will mention what kind of derivatives will be used for calculating data and smoothness term. The default smoothness term is anisotropic and non adaptive with respect to edge orientation.

<br>
The output generated when walking through the image pyramid states the **pyramid level** followed by the **image dimensions** at that level in parenthesis and the **outer iteration count**. Instead of running a fixed amount of iterations we check the **mean relative change in the displacement vectors** every ten iterations and continue to the next higher level once it drops below 0.5%. Thus, at least 20 iterations are calculated at every pyramid level. Using dynamic iteration counts allows us to avoid underfitting and motions will be identified higher in the pyramid where calculations are less costly. Next to the mean relative change the current **maximal change in any single displacement vector** and the achieved **(unmasked) cross-correlation** between Frame0 and Frame1 are also reported.
<br>
<br>
When the zero pyramid level terminates parameters for checking the consistency of the result are provided. These are:
- the relative amount of voxels remaining in the region of interest (**rel_valid**) because a reasonable evaluation should only exhibited little motion across the exterior image boundaries
- the 

Advanced parameters:
- LOCALGLOBAL
- DERIVATIVES
- create warp and error
