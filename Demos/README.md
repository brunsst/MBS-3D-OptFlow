# MBS-3D-OptFlow

MBS-3D-OptFlow provides fast and memory efficient digital volume correlation for Nvidia GPUs intended for the use with synchrotron Âµ-CT volume image data.

**26.04.2023:** Dumped the source code for knowledgeable users.

**Pending Updates**:
  - Streamlining of main.cpp (removing unused experimental features, workflows to separate files)
  - Documenting all available input parameters
  - Upload demo projects (ray cartiledge; NiTi wires)

## Quick Start Guide

### Compilation

Required libraries are LibTiff and OpenMP. The source code should compile on most Linux distributions by providing the **location of your nvcc compiler** and the **CUDA compute capability** of your GPU in the script file *build_mbsoptflow.sh*. Execute with 

***<p align="center"> sh build_mbsoptflow.sh </p>***

which will provide an executable *mbsoptflow* in the same directory.

### Performing DVC

It is highly recommended that you perform denoising and a rigid body registration (or at least a coarse manual registration of datasets) before calculating displacement fields with the DVC algorithm. Preregistering the data assures a large field of view and minimizes displacements. Larger motions across image boundaries and motions that are large in relation to the moving object may still pose problems.

You need to provide two greyscale tif-image sequences (8bit, 16bit or 32bit): a reference (Frame0) and a transformed image sequence (Frame1). 3D-tif files are also supported. Both image sequences need to be of the same height, widht and depth. The default output will be a dense field of displacement vectors. Frame0 and Frame1 are passed with the -i0 and -i1 argument. Currently there is no default output directory (will change that and at least catch exceptions from I/O). You need to provide it with the -o argument. Thus, the most basic program call would be:

***<p align="center"> ./mbsoptflow -i0 /path/to/my/reference/data/ -i1 /path/to/my/displaced/data/ -o /path/to/dvc/output/</p>***

A full list of available arguments and flags will follow. Right now you need to check the section *extract command line arguments* in *main.cpp* and/or *protocol_parameters.h*. The latter sets the default parameters used that can be overwritten by the arguments.

## Exemplary Program Calls

### Push-out tests on bone-screw implant systems (detecting strain and cracks)

*./mbsoptflow -i0 /reference/path/ -i1 /frame1/path/ -o /outpath/ -m /mask/path/<br>-alpha 0.05 -level 12 -scale 0.8 -norm histogram_linear_mask -prefilter gaussian 1 --median -gpu0 0<br>--export_warp --conhull_maxz -localglobal 3 -transform1 sqrt --extrapolate --mosaic_approximation -overlap 100 --export_error --bone_quality*

**Lessons:**
<br>
**-gpu0 0** sets the ID of the first GPU used. You can check the IDs of your GPUs with *nvidia-smi*.
<br>
**-alpha 0.05** controls the relative contribution of the smoothing term. Here, we use as little smoothing as possible and as much smoothing as necessary for locating emerging cracks precisely.
<br>
**-localglobal 3** activates a convolution of the data term. This requires more GPU memory but increases the robustness of the algorithm, especially in poorly textured regions. The integer defines the radius of the convolution kernel. Near optimal kernels are available with a radius of up to 4.
<br>
**--mosaic_approximation** activates a sequential approximation of displacements in overlapping subvolumes of image volumes exceeding GPU memory.
<br>
**-norm histogram_linear_mask** sets the method with which to normalize the data to a 0 to 1 interval. Here we stretch 99.9% of the dynamic range of the intensity histogram within the masked ROI. Maintaining brightness constancy is imperative and for zoom tomography and/or low detector counts the assumption may be violated. *linear* provides an additional transformation of Frame1 intensities by projecting extrema in the histogram with a linear transformation onto the corresponding extrema in Frame0.

### Tensile tests on wires made of shape memory alloys

*./mbsoptflow -i0 /frame0/ -i1 /frame1/ -o /outpath/ -m none -gradientmask 0 0.05 <br>-alpha 0.05 -norm histogram_independent -level 10 -scale 0.8 --skip_masking --export_warp -prefilter gaussian 0.5 -localglobal 3 -gpu0 2 -prestrain_ref 0.001 0.5*

**Lessons:**
<br>
**-m none -gradientmask 0 0.05** These data only have textures on the interface of the wire where etched pits can be found. Instead of using an external mask we use the internal option to calculate the gradient magnitude. The first number provided with the *-gradientmask* argument defines the sigma value for Gaussian blurring of the gradient image, whereas the second value defines the percentile of voxels used. In this case we use the 5% of voxels with the largest gradient magnitude.
<br>
**--skip_masking** This should be default by now. In the first version masked out values were assumed to be stationary by default in the displacement vector field. That turned out to be only useful for visualization purposes.
<br>
**-prestrain_ref 0.001 0.5** When performing a tensile test the sample extends beyond the field of view at the top and bottom of the image stack. Even more, the motion across this boundary is larger than the lateral contraction. We can aid the algorithm in finding a reasonable solution by straining the reference image by the expected tensile strain during the preprocessing step. This also maximizes the amount of information used from Frame1. The result is corrected for the prescribed strain. Here, we strain the reference image by 0.1% around the image center (*0.5*). 
<br>
**-norm histogram_independent** Instead of using a cumulative histogram from Frame0 and Frame1 for normalization adding *_independent* normalizes Frame0 and Frame1 using their individual histograms.

### Rearranged sand grains in a capillary flushed with nanoparticles 

*./mbsoptflow -i0 /reference/denoised/ -i1 /frame1/denoised/ -o /outpath/ -m /localotsu/mask/<br> -alpha 0.2 -norm histogram -scale 0.8 -level 18  -prefilter gaussian 0.5 -gpu0 0<br>--mosaic --export_warp --skip_vectors --binning*

**Lessons:**
<br>
**-m /localotsu/mask/** an externally provided mask limits the data term to the masked in regions. Regions excluded from the mask are interpolated. This is not strictly necessary but in CT data the background texture is often dominated by artefacts which we would like to ignore anyways.
<br>
**-alpha 0.2** In these datasets we can expect rigid body motions exclusively and the grains are quite large. Thus, smoothing can be substantially increased.
<br>
**-level 18** We need to increase the amount of pyramid levels to capture larger rearragements.
<br>
**--mosaic** These data are very large and won't fit on a single GPU. This activates a decomposition of the image volume into smaller subvolumes. In this mode boundaries between the subvolumes are updated after every outer iteration which is substantially slower than optimizing the subvolumes independently with *--mosaic_approximation*. I would try that first although that mode assumes that no motions larger than the overlap between subvolumes occur.
<br>
**--export_warp** creates an additional output of the morphed Frame1 which we are interested in for this study.
<br>
**--skip_vectors** turns off the displacement field output.
<br>
**--binning** skips the last pyramid level and upscales the vectors determined on the previous level. This is sufficient for the task and reduces the computational burden for huge datasets substantially.
<br>
<br>
@ Adrian: We performed the study before I had the localglobal-option implemented in its current format. I would try adding *-localglobal 3* and switch to *--mosaic_approximation*
